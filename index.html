<p>ThingML is developed as a domain-specific modeling language which includes concepts to describe both software components and communication protocols. The formalism used is a combination of architecture models, state machines and an imperative action language. The ThingML toolset includes text editors to create and edit ThingML models, a set of transformations to create diagrams from ThingML models and a set of code generators to compile ThingML to C (Linux and Arduino), Java and JavaScript (NodeJS and Browser).</p><br/>
